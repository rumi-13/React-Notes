## 🧠 What is Redux?

**Redux** is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications. It helps you manage the state of your application in a central place, making it easier to debug, test, and maintain, especially in large applications.

### 🔁 Why Use Redux?

1. **Centralized State Management**: All application state is stored in one object (the store), making it predictable and easy to debug.
2. **Predictable State Updates**: Changes to the state are made through *pure functions* called reducers, ensuring that the same input always gives the same output.
3. **Unidirectional Data Flow**: Data flows in one direction – from the state to the UI, and from UI to reducers via actions. This clarity simplifies reasoning about your app.
4. **Debugging Tools**: Redux DevTools help track every action and state change.
5. **Middleware Support**: You can handle asynchronous logic (like API calls) using middleware like redux-thunk or redux-saga.

### ⚙️ Core Concepts of Redux

* **Store**: The central object that holds the state.
* **Action**: A plain object that describes what happened.
* **Reducer**: A pure function that takes the current state and an action, and returns a new state.
* **Dispatch**: A method to send actions to the store.
* **Selector**: A function that selects a slice of the state.

## 🚀 What is Redux Toolkit?

**Redux Toolkit** is the official, recommended way to write Redux logic. It simplifies Redux development by abstracting boilerplate and encouraging best practices.

Redux Toolkit was introduced to make Redux more accessible and productive, especially for beginners.

### 🧰 Why Use Redux Toolkit?

1. **Less Boilerplate**: Redux Toolkit handles action creators, action types, and immutable updates automatically.
2. **Built-in DevTools & Middleware**: Comes with Redux DevTools and redux-thunk middleware out of the box.
3. **Simplified Store Setup**: The configureStore() API sets up everything you need.
4. **Slicing State**: Encourages dividing state into “slices,” each managing its own actions and reducer logic via createSlice.
5. **Immutable Updates Made Easy**: Uses Immer under the hood to allow writing "mutative" code that actually performs immutable updates.

### 🛠️ Key APIs in Redux Toolkit

* **configureStore()**: Sets up the Redux store with good defaults.
* **createSlice()**: Generates action creators and reducers in one go.
* **createAsyncThunk()**: Handles asynchronous logic like API requests.
* **createReducer()**: Builds reducers with builder syntax or object maps.
* **createAction()**: Helps create standalone action creators.

## 📘 When Should You Use Redux Toolkit?

* Use **Redux Toolkit** if:

  * You're starting a new Redux project.
  * You want a cleaner, easier, and faster way to implement Redux.
  * You’re frustrated with Redux boilerplate.
