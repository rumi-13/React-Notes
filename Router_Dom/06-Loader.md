# A Beginner’s Guide to React Router: Routing, Loaders, and URL Parameters

**React Router** is a popular library for React applications that manages navigation (routing) between different components. In a single-page app (SPA), you often want to show different “pages” or views without reloading the whole browser page. React Router lets you do this by mapping URL paths to specific React components. For example, you might show a Home component when the URL is `/`, and an About component at `/about`. This gives users a seamless experience — the URL changes, but the page doesn’t fully refresh ([React Router | GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reactjs-router/#:~:text=React%20Router%20is%20a%20standard,URL%20paths%20to%20specific%20components)).  

React Router works by using special components like `<BrowserRouter>`, `<Routes>`, and `<Route>` (from the `react-router-dom` package) to declare which component should appear for each path. It supports dynamic routes, nested routes, and client-side navigation so that clicks on links or calls to navigation functions happen instantly without a full reload ([React Router | GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reactjs-router/#:~:text=React%20Router%20is%20a%20standard,URL%20paths%20to%20specific%20components)). In short, React Router makes your app feel like a multi-page website while still running as one page.

## What Is a Loader?

In React Router (v6.4 and above), a **loader** is a function you can attach to a route that fetches any data your component will need *before* the component is displayed. Instead of having your component call `fetch()` inside `useEffect`, loaders allow React Router to handle data loading in advance. Each route can define a `loader` function that runs when the user navigates to that route ([loader v6.30.0 | React Router](https://reactrouter.com/6.30.0/route/loader#:~:text=Each%20route%20can%20define%20a,route%20element%20before%20it%20renders)). The router waits for this function to complete, then renders the component with the data ready. 

Here’s why loaders are useful:
- **Pre-fetch data:** Loaders run before the component renders, so you don’t have to show a blank page or manual loading spinner inside the component. This avoids “waterfall” loading chains by parallelizing data fetching ([loader v6.30.0 | React Router](https://reactrouter.com/6.30.0/route/loader#:~:text=As%20the%20user%20navigates%20around,available%20to%20components%20through%20useLoaderData)) ([Lazy Loading Routes in React Router 6.4+ | Remix](https://remix.run/blog/lazy-loading-routes#:~:text=React%20Router%206,that%20come%20along%20with%20them)).
- **Cleaner code:** You keep data fetching logic in one place (the route config) instead of inside your component, making your components simpler.
- **Built into routing:** Since the router calls loaders automatically on navigation, you don’t need additional state management for loading states. 

For example, imagine you have a “Posts” page that needs a list of posts from an API. You could set up a loader like this:

```jsx
import { createBrowserRouter, RouterProvider } from 'react-router-dom';

async function postsLoader() {
  // Fetch posts data before the PostsPage component renders
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/posts');
  return response.json();
}

const router = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/posts",
    loader: postsLoader,
    element: <PostsPage />
  }
]);

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <RouterProvider router={router} />
);
```

In this example, when the user goes to `/posts`, React Router calls `postsLoader()`. That function fetches the posts and returns the data. Only after the data is ready does React Router render the `<PostsPage />` component. As one guide notes, “as the user navigates between routes, the loaders are called before the route component is rendered” ([Data Loading  | React Router](https://reactrouter.com/start/data/data-loading#:~:text=As%20the%20user%20navigates%20between,the%20route%20component%20is%20rendered)).

## Using `useLoaderData`

Once a loader has fetched data, you need a way to access that data inside your component. React Router provides a hook called `useLoaderData()` for this purpose ([Data Loading  | React Router](https://reactrouter.com/start/data/data-loading#:~:text=The%20data%20is%20available%20in,useLoaderData)) ([useLoaderData v6.30.0 | React Router](https://reactrouter.com/6.30.0/hooks/use-loader-data#:~:text=)). When you call `useLoaderData()` inside a route component, it returns whatever the loader function returned. This hook does **not** itself fetch any data; it simply gives you the result that the router already fetched. 

Continuing the example above, your `PostsPage` component could look like this:

```jsx
import { useLoaderData } from 'react-router-dom';

function PostsPage() {
  // Get the data returned by postsLoader()
  const posts = useLoaderData();
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Blog Posts</h1>
      {posts.map(post => (
        <div key={post.id}>
          <h2>{post.title}</h2>
          <p>{post.body}</p>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

Here, `posts` will contain the array of post objects that `postsLoader` returned. React Router ensures that the loader function completes (fetching posts) before rendering `PostsPage`, so `useLoaderData()` immediately has the data. In other words, “the data is available in route components with `useLoaderData`” ([Data Loading  | React Router](https://reactrouter.com/start/data/data-loading#:~:text=The%20data%20is%20available%20in,useLoaderData)). 

**Steps to use loaders and `useLoaderData`:**  
- In your router configuration (using `createBrowserRouter` or similar), attach a `loader` function to the route object.  
- Inside the loader, fetch and return the data you need (this can be a promise or data object).  
- In the component for that route, call `useLoaderData()` to retrieve the data returned by the loader.  

This pattern keeps data fetching logic in the route layer and lets your components focus on displaying data.

## URL Parameters and `useParams`

Often your routes need dynamic segments. For example, you might have a user profile page with URLs like `/users/123` or `/users/abc`. React Router lets you define a **route parameter** using a colon, e.g. `<Route path="/users/:userId" element={<User />} />`. In this case, `:userId` is a placeholder that matches whatever value is in that part of the URL.

Inside your component, you can use the `useParams()` hook to read these values ([URL Values  | React Router](https://reactrouter.com/start/declarative/url-values#:~:text=Route%20params%20are%20the%20parsed,values%20from%20a%20dynamic%20segment)). For instance:

```jsx
import { useParams } from 'react-router-dom';

function UserPage() {
  // Retrieves an object of all route params (e.g. { userId: "123" })
  const { userId } = useParams();
  return <h2>User ID: {userId}</h2>;
}
```

If the URL is `/users/123`, this will render **User ID: 123**. The docs explain that “Route params are the parsed values from a dynamic segment… The parsed value for that city will be available from `useParams`” (for a route like `/cities/:city`) ([URL Values  | React Router](https://reactrouter.com/start/declarative/url-values#:~:text=Route%20params%20are%20the%20parsed,values%20from%20a%20dynamic%20segment)). This means any part of the path prefixed with `:` can be accessed inside the component with `useParams`.

You can also use route parameters inside loaders. When React Router calls a loader, it passes an object that includes the `params`. For example:

```jsx
const router = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/users/:userId",
    loader: async ({ params }) => {
      // params.userId contains the value from the URL
      const res = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/users/${params.userId}`);
      return res.json();
    },
    element: <UserDetailPage />
  }
]);
```

Here, if the URL is `/users/42`, then `params.userId` will be `"42"`. The loader can fetch data for that specific user before rendering. As the docs note, “Route params are parsed from dynamic segments and passed to your loader...the `:teamId` in the path is parsed and provided as `params.teamId` by the same name” ([loader v6.30.0 | React Router](https://reactrouter.com/6.30.0/route/loader#:~:text=Route%20params%20are%20parsed%20from,out%20which%20resource%20to%20load)) ([loader v6.30.0 | React Router](https://reactrouter.com/6.30.0/route/loader#:~:text=)). You can then use `useLoaderData()` in `UserDetailPage` to get the user’s data.


**Key points:**

- React Router maps URLs to React components, enabling seamless client-side navigation ([React Router | GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reactjs-router/#:~:text=React%20Router%20is%20a%20standard,URL%20paths%20to%20specific%20components)).  
- A **loader** function on a route fetches data before the component is shown ([loader v6.30.0 | React Router](https://reactrouter.com/6.30.0/route/loader#:~:text=Each%20route%20can%20define%20a,route%20element%20before%20it%20renders)) ([Data Loading  | React Router](https://reactrouter.com/start/data/data-loading#:~:text=As%20the%20user%20navigates%20between,the%20route%20component%20is%20rendered)).  
- Use the `useLoaderData()` hook inside the route component to access the loader’s returned data ([Data Loading  | React Router](https://reactrouter.com/start/data/data-loading#:~:text=The%20data%20is%20available%20in,useLoaderData)) ([useLoaderData v6.30.0 | React Router](https://reactrouter.com/6.30.0/hooks/use-loader-data#:~:text=)).  
- Define route parameters with `:name` in your path. Access them in a component with `useParams()` or in a loader via `params.name` ([URL Values  | React Router](https://reactrouter.com/start/declarative/url-values#:~:text=Route%20params%20are%20the%20parsed,values%20from%20a%20dynamic%20segment)) ([loader v6.30.0 | React Router](https://reactrouter.com/6.30.0/route/loader#:~:text=Route%20params%20are%20parsed%20from,out%20which%20resource%20to%20load)).

With these tools, you can build React apps that load and display data smoothly based on the URL, giving users a rich and responsive experience.
