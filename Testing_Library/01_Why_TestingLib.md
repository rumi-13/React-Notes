# Testing React Components with Jest and React Testing Library

As a developer  it's important to ensure that the app you create **works exactly as intended**.  
While you can manually test all parts of your app, as the project grows, manual testing becomes **tedious, error-prone, and time-consuming**.

This is where **automated tests** come into play!

In this article, you'll learn:
- Why testing is important
- Best practices for writing tests
- How to use **Jest** and **React Testing Library**
- A practical example of testing a React component

## Why Is Testing Important?

Testing your code is like a factory testing its products before selling them.  
It ensures that everything works properly and that the quality of the product (your app) is high.

**Benefits of testing:**
- Helps discover bugs early — before reaching users
- Reduces user complaints
- Saves time and money for the organization
- Boosts confidence when making new changes to your app

## Best Practices for Writing Tests

When writing tests, remember:

### 1. Avoid Implementation Details
- Tests should interact with the **actual DOM nodes**, not React-specific code.
- Users don’t know or care that React powers your app — they just interact with the UI.

### 2. Tests Should Resemble Real User Interactions
- The more your tests behave like a real user would (clicking, typing, reading text), the more valuable they are.

### 3. Tests Should Be Maintainable
- Tests shouldn't break unless **actual functionality changes**.
- Small internal changes in a component shouldn't force you to rewrite your tests.

## Introducing Jest and React Testing Library

### 1. Jest
- **Jest** is a JavaScript test runner.
- It uses a fake browser environment called **JSDOM** to simulate the browser.
- It has powerful features like:
  - **Mocking modules**: replacing complex parts with simpler, fake ones for easier testing.
  - **Fast iteration speed**.

### 2. React Testing Library
- A set of utilities to test React components **the way users would use them**.
- Encourages best practices:
  - No reliance on component internals
  - Focused on real user behavior
- Comes **pre-installed** and **pre-configured** with **Create React App** projects.

## Example: Testing a Link in the App

Imagine that Little Lemon is getting listed on a popular restaurant aggregator.  
You need to make sure that a **link to Little Lemon's webpage** always appears on the app.

Here’s how to write an automated test for it:

---

### Step 1: Import Needed Functions
```javascript
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import App from './App';
```
- `render()` — renders your component in a fake DOM.
- `screen` — allows easy querying of elements.

---

### Step 2: Write the Test
```javascript
test('renders Little Lemon Restaurant link', () => {
  render(<App />);

  const linkElement = screen.getByText('Little Lemon Restaurant');

  expect(linkElement).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

**Explanation:**
- `test()` — provided by Jest to define a test case.
- Inside the test:
  - `render(<App />)` — displays the App component.
  - `screen.getByText('Little Lemon Restaurant')` — searches for text.
  - `expect(...).toBeInTheDocument()` — checks if the element was found.

---

### Step 3: Fix Any Errors
If the test **fails**, read the output message carefully.  
For example, if you mistakenly wrote "Little Orange Restaurant" instead of "Little Lemon Restaurant", the test will fail, helping you catch the typo.

## Final Thoughts

By now, you have learned:
- Why automated testing is important
- Best practices for writing reliable tests
- How to use Jest and React Testing Library
- How to create simple but powerful tests that mimic user behavior

Testing makes your app **robust**, **reliable**, and **easier to maintain**.  
Soon, you'll be writing even more complex tests with ease!
